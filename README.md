## installation
Working on getting this uploaded to the store. For now:
1. Download a release
2. Unzip it
3. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable developer mode, click `Load unpacked` and select the folder containing the unzipped theme

## development
Issues/PRs welcome!
If you need help, see this [guide](https://github.com/mike-u/EditChromeThemes) on editing already created Chrome themes. Google also provides some (limited) [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/themes#manifest) for working with themes.
